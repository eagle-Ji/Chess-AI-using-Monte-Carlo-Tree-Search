# Chess-AI-using-Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search
This repository contains an implementation of a chess-playing AI using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for action selection and Stockfish as an opponent for benchmarking. The agent simulates chess games and evaluates performance using centipawn scores and win/loss/tie counts.
